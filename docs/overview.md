## Overview

Goals: Build a minimal quant factor pipeline from cataloged data to coded factors, quick test, persistence, strategy composition and run.

Key steps
1. Select fields (Catalog â†’ Selections)
2. Generate factor code (Coding Agent or scaffold) based on selection context
3. Quick test with standardization preview
4. Save factor
5. Create strategy
6. Assign factor weights (decide standardization + weight normalization)
7. Run strategy (Top N)

Core principles
- Data-driven via JSON catalog
- Secure sandboxed factor execution
- Modular APIs, simple persistence, scalable later
